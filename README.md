# Cryptocurrencies

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning on cryptocurrency data. First, I preprocess the data for PCA. I then reduce the data dimensions to 3 principal components using PCA, and place these dimensions in a new dataframe. The next step was to create an elbow curve to find the best value for K. Next, I cluser the cryptocurrencies using the K-means algorithm. Finally, I visualize the results by creating a 3D scatter plot. I added the CoinName and and Algorithm to show on hover.
